## üìñ About Peebify
Peebify Launcher started so I could begin to learn about JavaScript, and it's built with a combination of **hand-written** & **ai** code, if you want to help out feel free but honestly good luck.
## Administrator Required for Full Functionality
- **Why?** Peebify requires administrator access to enable the "Force Game Close" feature in Quick Settings.
