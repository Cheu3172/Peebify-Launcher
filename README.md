## 📖 About Peebify
Peebify started so I could learn a bit more about JavaScript, and it's built with a combination of hand-written code and a little help from AI. This public repository is mainly for the auto-update function and releases.
## Administrator Required for Full Functionality
- **Why?** Peebify requires administrator access to enable the "Force Game Close" feature in Quick Settings.
## Can I unpackage Peebify Launcher?
- **Yeah!** Go right ahead, I don't care if you wanna see the source code :D just uhh- ignore the garbage coding :p
