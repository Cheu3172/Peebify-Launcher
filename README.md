# Peebify Launcher
Peebify is an alternative launcher for the game Wuthering Waves, created out of sheer boredom; it's a passion project packed with all the functionality you'd expect from a modern launcher.

## ‚ú® Future Plans
- ~~Update the visuals on the Launcher Update & Install prompt~~ (Peebify Launcher V2.3.0+)
- ~~Update the visuals, or remove the play-time editor prompt~~ (Peebify Launcher V2.3.0+)
- Update the visuals, and data shown for repair game to show more useful information.
- ~~Update the visuals of the actual notification inside of the launcher notification tray.~~ (Peebify Launcher V2.3.0+)
- Change the auto-updater for launcher to be apart of the pre-checks to open the launcher, than prompt right after full open.
- Change the game auto-updater to be apart of the pre-checks to open the launcher, than prompt to install/update after full open.
- Add an actual installer so we don't use electrons installer everytime, same for updater (This is a lot of work)
- Add a warning prompt to "Uninstall Game"
- Add a warning prompt to "Move Game Install"
- Add a notification for "Uninstall Game", "Move Game Install", "Automatic Check-update", etc...
- Add a Pity Tracker
- Add a Inventory tracker (Try to find an automatic way, might be manual updates done by user)
- Add a setting to hide certain elements such as Social Tray, Quick Settings, Community Tools, Side-bar, etc. This would go under "appearance"
## Bugs :(
- Launcher Update sometimes reads "You're on the latest install" even though the user is actually not... usually occurs when an update is pushed and their launcher is already open.
- ~~Launcher when opened sometimes does not recall launcher configuration, this may be fixed! Waiting on reports.~~

## üìñ About Peebify
Peebify started so I could learn a bit more about JavaScript, and it's built with a combination of hand-written code and a little help from AI. This public repository is mainly for the auto-update function and releases.
## Administrator Required for Full Functionality
- **Why?** Peebify requires administrator access to enable the "Force Game Close" feature in Quick Settings.
